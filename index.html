      <p>Resume</p>
      <p>Personal Statement</p>
      <p>As a seasoned Information Technology (IT) professional with over 4 years of industry experience, I thrive on staying at the forefront of technology. My passion lies in
        leveraging innovative solutions to enhance business processes. Currently, I'm diving into Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to master best practices for managing
        infrastructure efectively. Simultaneously, I'm pursuing associate-level Microsoft certifcations, which will benefit my Cloud Engineering journey. I would be a great
        addition to any business that incorporates information systems into their business models. <br><br>
        I have experience in on-premise, hybrid to full cloud administration, and scripting. Secondary to technical support for endpoints, networking, licensing, ITSM,
        governance and information security. I have proven people skills, excellent communication and leadership skills. I work well within a team, and can manage and set
        my own pace when working alone.</p>
